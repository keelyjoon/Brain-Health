# Brain-Health
To run the Brain Health Chat Bot you must run the chat_bot.py file.
This uses tkinter to open a GUI where the user can interact with the chatbot.
The user will be prompted to answer questions like:
"How are you feeling?" and "Which school are you located at?"
This information will be used to open a correlating website with Mental Health Resources for the user in their specific location.
